        <p>Our liberties and our nation’s glorious destiny will no longer be denied.  And we will immediately restore the integrity, competency, and loyalty of Americas government.</p>
        <p>Over the past eight years, I have been tested and challenged more than any president in our 250-year history, and I’ve learned a lot along the way.</p>
        <p>The journey to reclaim our republic has not been an easy one — that, I can tell you.  Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom and, indeed, to take my life.</p>
        <p>Just a few months ago, in a beautiful Pennsylvania field, an assassin’s bullet ripped through my ear.  But I felt then and believe even more so now that my life was saved for a reason.  I was saved by God to make America great again.</p>
