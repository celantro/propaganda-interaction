            <p>In recent years, our nation has suffered greatly. But we are going to bring it back and make it great again, greater than ever before. </p>
            <p>We will be a nation like no other, full of compassion, courage, and exceptionalism.  Our power will stop all wars and bring a new spirit of unity to a world that has been angry, violent, and totally unpredictable. </p>
            <p>America will be respected again and admired again, including by people of religion, faith, and goodwill.  We will be prosperous, we will be proud, we will be strong, and we will win like never before. </p>
            <p>We will not be conquered, we will not be intimidated, we will not be broken, and we will not fail.  From this day on, the United States of America will be a free, sovereign, and independent nation. </p>
            <p>We will stand bravely, we will live proudly, we will dream boldly, and nothing will stand in our way because we are Americans.  The future is ours, and our golden age has just begun.</p>
            <p>Thank you.  God bless America.  Thank you all.  Thank you. </p>
